# MTFC Scenario Phase

Scenario-phase modeling code used for the Modeling the Future Challenge workflow.

This repository is intentionally scoped: it captures the assumptions, transformations, and outputs used in the scenario phase so the work can be audited and reproduced.

---

## What this does

- Encodes scenario assumptions and parameter choices
- Produces scenario outputs (tables/figures) from the same inputs deterministically
- Keeps the scenario phase cleanly separated from exploratory analysis

---

## Repository contents

- `scenariophase.ipynb` — primary workflow notebook

---

## How to run

1) Create a Python environment.  
2) Install dependencies.  
3) Run `scenariophase.ipynb` top-to-bottom.

---

## Outputs

- Scenario tables and charts exported from the notebook
